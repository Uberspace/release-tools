# Release Tools

**VERSION**: `0.5.0`

This is a [Python Docker Image][], that comes with `git` and some other tools
installed, that can help with release related tasks:

-   [black]
-   [bumpversion]
-   [cookie-cutter]
-   [invoke]
-   [pre-commit]
-   [reno]
-   [safety]

It's available on [Docker Hub][] as `uberspace/release-tools`.

## ðŸš¸ Usage

The default is to run as the _user_ `root` from `/usr/local/src/` as _working
directory_. The _entry point_ is set to `/usr/local/bin/invoke`. You can use
`--workdir /foo`, `--user $(id -u):$(id -g)` and the `--entrypoint` flag to
change that.

### Alias

You can create the following _alias_ for running this image:

```shell
alias dkr-release="docker run --rm \
    --volume "$(pwd)":/usr/local/src \
    --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
    uberspace/release-tools"
```

### Tools

You can use the installed tools directly, by setting them as _entry points_:

```shell
docker run --rm --entrypoint black uberspace/release-tools --help
```

### Tasks

If you run this image (e.g. with the alias above), it presents you a list of
[Invoke] tasks:

    release              Write CHANGELOG and BUMP version.
    audit
        .requirements*   Print compromised packages in req-file.
    git
        .ignore          Print `.gitignore` for `--ids`.
        .list*           Print list of available IDs.
    notes
        .lint            Check release notes for RST errors.
        .list*           Print list of release note files.
        .new             Create new release note.
        .preview         Print preview of change log.
        .write           Write change log to file.
    setup
        .all*            Setup version & release notes management.
        .notes           Create `releasenotes` tree in current directory.
        .version         Create `.bumpversion.cfg` in current directory.
    version
        .bump            Bump version based on `--part`.
        .current*        Print current version.
        .next            Print next version based on `--part`.

The _command arguments_ given to `docker run â€¦` are passed to `invoke` - e.g. to
run lint your release notes, you can run `dkr-release notes.lint`.

### Workflow

1. **Setup**: run `dkr-release setup` once, to create the necessary file
   structure (you generally run this from the root of your repo).

2. **Add Notes**: If you are ready commit changes, you can use
   `dkr-release notes.new`, to create a new release notes file, to edit and add
   to your commit.

3. **Release** You create an up to date _CHANGELOG_ and bump the version by
   running `dkr-release release`. By default this bumps the _patch_ number, but
   you can bump the _minor_ or _major_ number (or everything else you have
   configured) by passing it along via the `--part` flag, e.g.
   `dkr-release release --part minor`.

## ðŸ”– Release

If you're ready to release a new version, pleaseâ€¦

1. ensure a clean repo (everything merged, release notes readyâ€¦),

2. run the `release` task, to create the _CHANGELOG_, _bump the version_
   and tag the commits:

    ```shell
    docker run --rm \
        --volume "$(pwd)":/usr/local/src \
        --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
        uberspace/release-tools release
    ```

3. and run `git push` and `git push --tags`.

## ðŸš€ Deployment

Pushes to _master_ trigger builds on [Docker Hub][].

Change `requirements.txt` to control the installed software (and versions) and
set the `PYTHON_VERSION` environment variable, to set the Docker tag used for
the Python base image.

**NOTE** We use `3-slim` as default tag for now (instead of `3-alpine`), because
the _dulwich_ compilation bails on _Alpine_.
